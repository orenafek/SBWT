#### Developed in Scala (2.12) using SBT (0.13.8)

#### Project Type
This is a research project, hoping to be graded with a 100 :).

### Project Goals
In this project we implement the Bijective String Sorting Transform suggested by [Gil & Scott]( http://bijective.dogma.net/00yyy.pdf), which is based on the Burrows Wheeler Transform.
We also implement the standard Burrows Wheeler Transform.
This includes an implementation of a suffix array sorter which runs in linear time.


### Project Aspects 

* Bijective ...

* Triplet Sorter ....

* Technicalities

> In order to be consistant with the paper's sugested algorithems, we've used some greek alphabetic notions when naming variables and methods. In order to stay fully consistant, we've left some variables that should have normally been inlined, as they are.

* Linear Time :
