#### Developed in Scala (2.12) using SBT (0.13.8)

### Project Goals
This project seggests a concreate implementation in Scala to the **A Bijective String Sorting Transform, by Gil & Scott** http://bijective.dogma.net/00yyy.pdf.
Our implementation introduces a new, improved way of sorting strings, in a ** linear time (O(n)) **
 TODO: ORI ADD SOME MORE BLA BLA BLA
 
 
### Project Aspects 

* Bijective ...

* Triplet Sorter ....

* Technicalities

> In order to be consistant with the paper's sugested algorithems, we've used some greek alphabetic notions when naming variables and methods. In order to stay fully consistant, we've left some variables that should have normally been inlined, as they are. `

* Linear Time :
